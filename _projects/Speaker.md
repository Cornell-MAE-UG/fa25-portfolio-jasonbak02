## MAE 3230 Final Project

My group's fluid dynamics dissection involved dissassembling and analyzing the fluid components that allowed a speaker to produce sound. My role within the project was to create a 5-minute script, as well as record, act and edit the final video. The combination of writing the script, learning the lines, and editing it on video allowed me to understand more about the speaker than I would have thought, and I can confidently say that I am an expert on propogation fluid flow.
